# Rocket Man

I was bored and thought it would be funny to have a little Rocket flying through space..... Two days Later and this little Project came about. It isn't much yet but I still have some ideas on how to improve the game. All assets are random Free-Assets I downloaded from the internet. Please share this Project if you like it.




## Installation

To try it yourself, just download the lastest Artifact from "out/artifacts/Rocket_Man_jar". You'll need at least Java 17 to run it.

Alternitavely, you can just build it yourself from the source code. Feel free to message me if you encounter any errors (or fix the yourself if you like xD)
