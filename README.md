# Rocket Man

## Introduction
I was bored and thought it would be funny to have a little rocket flying through space..... Two days later and this little project came about. It isn't much yet but I still have some ideas on how to improve the game. All assets are random Free-Assets I downloaded from the internet. I do not use any 3rd party library. All code is completely written from scratch (and therefore quite inefficient and a bit laggy xD). Feel free to share this Project if you like it.

## Installation
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **You will need at least Java 17 to run this game!**

To try it yourself, just download the lastest release from [Releases](https://github.com/Prinz-Autistimus/rocketman/releases) or download the latest artifact from [this site](https://github.com/Prinz-Autistimus/rocketman/tree/master/out/artifacts/Rocket_Man_jar). You'll need at least Java 17 to run it.

Alternitavely, you can just build it yourself from the source code. Feel free to message me if you encounter any errors (or fix them yourself if you like xD)
